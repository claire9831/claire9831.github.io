			Live version of Blessed is the best I’ve ever heard. <br>
			The drummer was amazing… adding beats at just the right places. <br>
			The bridge made me speechless... <br>
			“I’m coming back home to you. <br>
			<br>
			I love how he writes about the most universal emotions: attachment, tenderness, gratefulness, selflessness, sense of belonging. The little moments where two souls are so close to each other. <br>
			The moments that all human beings feel, but only few truly cherish and let penetrate their senses completely. He is one of them. I was brought to a separate dimension space, in which I could only sense the atmosphere closed in it. Nothing else. <br>
			It’s the most precious, the most pure.
			<br>
			<br>
			For three months straight, Daniel Caesar was the only thing playing. It’s almost like Seattle's background music. It was a treasurable time: alone, undistracted, spontaneous. Like Daniel’s voice, Seattle was a separate space, in which all it mattered was the present, the emotions that lived inside, and the thoughts arised… new imaginations, new understandings, new discoveries of self and others, and so much more.
			<br>
			<br>
			Times like these are like golden dusts sprinkled on top of the ordinary.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			"Yes I’m a mess but I’m blessed to be stuck with you. 
			Sometimes it gets unhealthy. We can’t be by ourselves we."
